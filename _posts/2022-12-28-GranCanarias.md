The phone clock hauled at 5:30, making me bouncing up the bed. I walked through the room my family lived for the Christmas holiday, 2022, with my figures running on the switchers to light the lamps in the room. "Wake up, Shasha and Jianjian! We're going to catch the flight at 8:00."

Breakfast boxes awaited us at the reception. Quick check-out. The taxi stopped outside the hotel waiting for us to get to the airport. Face mask on. Went off the hotel.

At the airport, we followed the process as usual, check-in, security check, buying a mug of coffee and bottles of water, boarding and sitting on seats in a row, 5A to 5C this time, with the belts fasten.

The airplane took off. Jianjian, who sat by the window, murmured "Goodbye, Spain!" while, in my mind, I was hoping a safe trip back to Gothenburg.
